Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a wbesite that is suppose to introduce a tourist to the country of Peru, the country where I was born and I am currently working on this class. Each file is either an html page, a css page, or a scss page to allow me to use variables when styling webpages.Each webpage covers a different topic that a typical tourist who is about to visit Peru will like to know.
